# The 500 foot cab ride

The data was too large to upload to github, but it's all available at the [NYC TLC website](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). I really should be using a more sophisticated manner to deal with big data, but for now it's all simple python scripts. [taxi_distances.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/taxi_distances.py) divides all the trips into different length buckets; the results are in [taxi_distances.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/taxi_distance.csv). Where all those microrides occured is done via [taxi_map.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/taxi_map.py) and logged in [taxi_coordinates.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/taxi_coordinates.csv). And finally, the hard-to-explain cash-paid and negotiated rides are sorted for with [shady.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/shady.py) and logged in [shady.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/shady.csv). All these dataset are fed into [taxi.R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/500_foot_Taxis/blob/master/taxi.R) to create the graphs.
